**Welcome to our user Wiki!** This document explains how to use our app.

</div>

## **Introduction**


<br/>

**EasySave** is a graphical, multi-platform backup tool. It enables users to **create**, **manage**, and **execute** backup jobs with ease.
Whether performing **full** or **differential** backups, EasySave ensures your data is securely backed up.

You can **download** and **execute** the EasySave app from the following link: [EasySave v3.0 Release](https://github.com/CESI-Genie-logiciel-G4/EasySave/releases/tag/v3.0).

## **Main Features**

### **Navigating the Menu**

EasySave's menu is divided into three main sections:

- **Backup Jobs**: Manage and execute backup jobs.
- **Create a Backup Job**: Define a backup job by specifying a source and destination.
- **History**: View the history of executed backup jobs.
- **Settings**: Configure the application's language, logs output format and more.

<br/>


### **Creating a Backup Job**
A backup job is a named link between two **existing** files. Once created, it allows copying content from the source to the destination on demand.

Three backup strategies are available:
- **Full**: Recopies all files at each execution.
- **Synthetic Full**: Only new files are copied, creating a full backup by merging changes with the last 
full backup.
- **Differential**: Copies only new or modified files since the last full backup, saving them in a separate location.

### **Task Status Indicators**

EasySave provides visual feedback on backup tasks through color-coded progress bars, making it easy to monitor their status at a glance.

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th>Color</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Pending</strong></td>
        <td>â¬› Gray (Indeterminate)</td>
        <td>Task is queued and waiting to start</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Running</strong></td>
        <td>ðŸŸ¦ DodgerBlue</td>
        <td>Task is actively processing files</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Paused</strong></td>
        <td>ðŸŸ§ Orange</td>
        <td>Task has been temporarily paused by the user</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Completed</strong></td>
        <td>ðŸŸ© Green</td>
        <td>Task has successfully completed all operations</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Failed</strong></td>
        <td>ðŸŸ¥ Red</td>
        <td>Task encountered an error and could not complete</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Blocked</strong></td>
        <td>ðŸŸ§ Orange (Indeterminate)</td>
        <td>Task is waiting for another process or resource</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Canceled</strong></td>
        <td>â¬› Gray</td>
        <td>Task was manually canceled by the user</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Wainting</strong></td>
        <td>ðŸŸ§ Orange</td>
        <td>Task is waiting for another task to complete</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The task status is reflected in real-time through the UI, allowing users to quickly identify which tasks require attention.

### **File Encryption**

EasySave encrypts files with specified extensions using AES when configured in backup tasks.

### **Creating a Backup Job**
A backup job is a named link between two **existing** files. Once created, it allows copying content from the source to the destination on demand.

Two backup strategies are available:
- **Full**: Recopies all files at each execution.
- **Differential**: Copies only recently modified files.

> **Limit**: The community version allows creating up to **5** backup jobs.

      <td>Launch all jobs within a specified range.</td>

      <td><code>1;3;5</code></td>
      <td>Launch specific jobs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

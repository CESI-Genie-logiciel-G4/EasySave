## **Introduction**


<br/>

**EasySave** is a robust, multi-platform, console-based backup tool. It enables users to **create**, **manage**, and **execute** backup jobs with ease.
Whether performing **full** or **differential** backups, EasySave ensures your data is securely backed up.

You can **download** and **execute** the EasySave app from the following link: [EasySave v1.1 Release](https://github.com/CESI-Genie-logiciel-G4/EasySave/releases/tag/v1.1).

### **Creating a Backup Job**
A backup job is a named link between two **existing** files. Once created, it allows copying content from the source to the destination on demand.

Three backup strategies are available:
- **Full**: Recopies all files at each execution.
- **Synthetic Full**: Only new files are copied, creating a full backup by merging changes with the last 
full backup.
 **Differential**: Copies only new or modified files since the last full backup, saving them in a separate location.

> **Limit**: No limit on the number of backup jobs.

### **Executing Backups**
EasySave offers flexible management of backup jobs through simplified expressions:


<div align="center">
  <table style="width:50%">
    <tr>
      <td><code>1</code></td>
      <td>Launch a single job.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>1-3</code></td>
      <td>Launch all jobs within a specified range.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>1;3;5</code></td>
      <td>Launch specific jobs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
      <td>Launch all saved jobs.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
